_Prune unused packages from your python project and more._

**PyPrune** has a few goals:

+ To easily navigate and remove used, unused, and untracked python packages.
+ To quickly identify disk usage of packages in the above categories. 
+ To view the relationship between various packages and their dependencies. 

To achieve those, **PyPrune**:

+ Collects all project imports by walking the [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).
+ Collects all declared dependencies from the [dependency specification file](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/).
+ Maps local environment [site-packages](https://ffy00.github.io/blog/02-python-debian-and-the-install-locations/) to resolve dependencies and the        imports they expose.
+ Identifies local site-package dependencies as to not accidently remove actively used dependencies of other packages.
+ Calculates package(s) size, and total disk usage.

### Package States

+ `-used` is when the package is locally installed, one of it's aliases is actively used in the project, and a corresponding dependency is declared in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`. This state indicates a fully integrated and properly managed package.

+ `-unused` is when the package is locally installed, and a corresponding dependency is declared in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`, but is not actively used in the project. **Caveat:** This package must not be a dependency of any actively `-used` package to be considered unused.

+ `-untracked` is when the package is installed, and one of it's aliases is actively used in the project, but is not declared in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`. This highlights packages that are implicitly used but not formally declared, which may lead to inconsistencies or issues in dependency management and deployment.



## Demo

```
 ðŸ“¦ Unused Packages

 package      | version      | size     
--------------+--------------+----------
 scikit-learn | ^1.4.1.post1 | 46.9 MiB 
 keras        | ^3.0.5       | 8.8 MiB  
 pydantic     | ^1.9.0       | 3.1 MiB  

 ðŸ’½ Total disk space: 58.9 MiB

 Note: There might be false-positives.
       For example, PyPrune cannot detect usage of packages that are not imported under `[tool.poetry.*]`.
       Similarly, it can only detect declared packages in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml.

## How fast?

Ridiculously fast!
